In progress!

## Things to try:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confirm-alert
- Maybe implement a change lock feature?
- Add expandible cheat sheet on the side
- Pop-out (into fixed-scroll) cypher list?
- Maybe see if I can integrate Redux

## To Do

- Make it responsive
- Add ability to download sheet as json (and import json)
